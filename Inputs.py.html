<span class="s0"># Task: Simulate using discrete-event simulation an urgent care unit that has 20 physicians and 1 Mental Health (MH) Specialist.</span>
<span class="s0"># Patients will also get screened for depression during their exam. If the result is positive, they will be seen by an on-site mental health specialist before leaving the urgent care.</span>
<span class="s0"># Forwarded to MH care only after completing their visit with the primary care physician.</span>
